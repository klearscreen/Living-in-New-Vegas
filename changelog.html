        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>11/12/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Vault 22 Flora Overhaul (sorry, thought I did this a while ago. Its not very well made and the changes are not worth the severe performance issues)
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>11/11/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Updated the WMIM Addendum (now includes YUP fixes, another reverted buff, and restored iron sights for the plasma pistol) <br>
                - Because of the above change, the Core Conflict resolution is no longer needed (now includes YUP fixes, and the UPNVSE patch only had two fixes, one which was solved by changing load order and another which was also added to the addendum [though the addendum does not require UPNVSE at all]) <br>
                - All load orders were updated to move UPNVSE below WMIM <br>
                - Replaced BLEED with Fallout 4 Survival Mode-Style Damage (it finally happened lads) <br>
                - To reflect the above change, the Gameplay Conflict Resolution was updated <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>11/2/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                THE UPDATES WILL NEVER STOP <br>
                - Added B42 Weapon Inertia along with a custom script that makes the inertia values editable through an INI to Textures/Models/Animations (the default values are also now lower, which pretty much removes the tilted pip-boy bug, which is why the mod wasn't added in the first place. Thanks to Xilandro for giving me permission to release this) <br>
                - Added a mod to Content - Perks that includes the Improved Traits xEdit instructions plus a couple other fixes (details in the read-me) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>11/1/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed the LOD Addition and Improvement special installation instructions and the ESP replacer (the mod was updated to remedy all the issues that these fixed) <br>
                - Added a note to disable anti-overlay in the JIP CCC MCM to prevent conflicts with HUD Editor <br>
                - Moved the HUD Editor below Vanilla HUD Cleaned in the HUD section (also moved below the gameplay/content finish line separators in their respective steps) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>10/28/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - [General] Fixed various typos/oversights from last update <br>
                - [Core] Added a note about NVR making Improved Lighting Shaders crash the game (NVR isn't used in the guide but a lot of people use it, so it was worth adding) <br>
                - [Core] Added a note about making sure your texture size is set to large, no matter what you set your graphics options to <br>
                - [Content] Added I Fought the Law - NCR Start to Content Optional (was supposed to add it last update but forgot) <br>
            </p>

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>10/27/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                Finally getting around to adding a bunch of new mods that have released recently (oh no it turned out to be a lot more than that, who is surprised). I just started college and moved houses so I've been very busy, but I finally have some free time so here it goes (why can't I stop changing stuff help me): <br>
                If you were unfortunate enough to be in the middle of doing the guide when this update hit, I'm sorry but you are much better off just starting all the way over. <br>
                - [General] Install normally and Special install instructions are now colored different to avoid any confusion (normal is now the same steel color as the descriptions, and the special install stuff is the same orange color as before) <br>
                - [General] Updated all load orders and conflict resolutions to reflect the following changes <br>
                - [General] Completely removed zMerge and anything relating to merging (merging isn't really necessary anymore with the Mod Limit Fix, the merging was a major source of confusion and can cause very big problems if done incorrectly) <br>
                - [Core] The guide now says to use the Ultra preset in the launcher with a note about using High if you want better performance for slightly worse visuals, rather than the other way around <br>
                - [Core] Moved MO2 Plugins to the optional core section (now that merging isn't used in the guide, it isn't necessary. But the sync mod profiles is still good) <br>
                - [Core] Added New Vegas Heap Replacer to Utilities <br>
                - [Core] Added Improved Lighting Shaders to Utilities <br>
                - [Core] lStewieAl's Tweaks Custom INI updated (enabled new features <i>bHideRedCrosshairOnDistantInvisibleTargets</i>, <i>bLessRestrictiveVATSMenu</i>, <i>bNoTurningAnim</i>, <i>bScaleMusicVolumeDuringDialogue</i>, <i>bCenterOnCellAcceptsFormIDs</i>, <i>bDelayPostCombatReputationPopup</i>, <i>bLocationalMeleeDamage</i>, <i>bLoopingReloadAmmoSwapRefillClipFix</i>, <i>bNoFreeBarterItems</i>, <i>bRememberWeaponAmmos</i> and enabled the <i>Hide HUD Hotkey</i> option [set to the "I" key by default]) <br>
                - [Core] Added WMIM Wrist Fix to Bug Fixes/QOL <br>
                - [Core] Removed Throwable Weapon Fixes from Bug Fixes/QOL (most if not all of the actual fixes are already done by WMIM, the remaining changes are all gameplay/visual changes which didn't fit the Core module) <br>
                - [Core] Added an ESP replacer for Fix for Legion Armors that scripts the changes from the mod to avoid conflicts (realized the mod had open permissions, so thanks to the original author YanL for doing that) <br>
                - [Core] This is probably gonna be controversial, but its gonna save me a lot of headache. Removed DarnUI support for the HUD section (was becoming way to much of a PITA to manage both sections, especially with how little time I have now and the additions of Vanilla HUD Cleaned, the new VUI+ patch in Consistent Pip-Boy Icons, and the addition of HUD Editor [HUD Editor only supports VUI+, and VHUD Cleaned needs a little extra work to work with Darn]) <br>
                - [Core] Replaced oHUD with HUD Editor + the "Hide HUD Hotkey" option in Stewie's Tweaks (by default, the hotkey is the "I" key. I've had my eye on HUD Editor for a while now and its finally been updated to a place where I feel comfortable finally getting rid of oHUD) <br>
                - [Core] Moved Tutorial Killer to the Optional section (since the Core module is often used by people who have never played the game, I figured this is a little better) <br>
                - [Core] Added Vanilla HUD Cleaned to HUD/UI <br>
                - [Core] Removed Vanilla HUD Remastered and the Vanilla HUD Remastered - VUI+ Patch (not needed with the new Vanilla HUD Cleaned mod + the new VUI+ patch in the Consistent Pip-Boy Icons FOMOD) <br>
                - [Visuals] Removed Millenia's Env Map Shader Package Fix from Tex/Models/Animations (not needed with Improved Lighting Shaders, as it has fixed versions of the shaders from this mod) <br>
                - [Visuals] Added Weapon Textures from Heaven to High/Medium Textures/Models/Anims <br>
                - [Visuals] Added instructions to install the Landscape seam fix file from WFO
                - [Visuals] Swapped out Iron Sights Recoil Animations, its patches, and Subtle Camera Motion for Anniversary Anim Pack (by the same author, includes those mods plus a few new bits) <br>
                - [Visuals] Swapped out Simple Street Lights for A Little More Lamplight (although Simple Street Lights covers a good bit more, More Lamplight is a lot simpler and much better made. Plus I don't think all the new lights SSL adds are all that necessary now that RWL Redesigned doesn't have very dark nights, and because the night brightness is changeable in the MCM) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Updated the JSUE addendum to now include a pre-configured INI file <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed the instructions to install the <strong>Mojave Raiders - .22LR Varmint Rifle Patch</strong> file from Mojave Raiders, as its not needed with the new Mojave Raiders - JSUE patch that was added recently <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Ammo Count Memory from Mechanics (redundant with newest Stewie's tweaks update) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Melee Cleave (this was mainly added to help buff melee weapons with BLEED, since the vanilla bug that caused melee damage not to be affected by damage multipliers made melee weapons really ineffective. But now that this bug is fixed in Stewie's Tweaks, I don't feel like this mod is completely necessary) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Alternative Repairing (I want Fallout 3-Style repairing from JIP LN to play more of an effect, and I want people to have to actually pay for repairs off vendors sometimes) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Super Mutant Overhaulord (Qolore Gameplay Tweaks now has similarly buffs super mutants, which is the main reason I used the mod) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Bypass Minigames (bForceLockpickNoBreakLock in Stewie's Tweaks, which makes failing a force lockpick attempt break the bobby pin instead of the lock, achieves pretty much the same goal) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Recharger Rifle Rebalance with Scope Mod (was never fully happy with the balance in this mod, it feels a bit OP. I plan on changing around the recharger rifle in QGT at some point) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Added instructions to install the VW Perception Affects Ranged Accuracy file from Vicious Wastes Standalone Mechanics in addition to the barter file <br>
                - [Content] Added instructions for installing the LSO uncut wasteland patch (I guess I just forgot to add it) <br>
                - [Content] Made an optional content section, which Cut Sewers Restored, Beyond the Beef Tweaks, Securitrons on High Alert, Vault 22 Flora Overhaul, Cloud Grenades, Z-43, Burden to Bear Original, and Immersive Pickup Sounds were moved to <br> <br>
                Holy shit its finally done, only took like a month and a half. My brain is pretty much dead now so there's totally gonna be a few typos and all that, but I think I did a pretty good job of actually adding everything to the changelog. I feel like the guide is pretty much perfect now, the only mod I can think of that I'm considering is MoreMojave, which looks amazing but it's gonna require rather extensive testing which I don't have time for currently. Maybe over Christmas break if I don't hate myself enough yet <br>

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>9/13/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Updated Gameplay Conflict Resolution FOMOD (removed the Mojave Raiders - JSUE patch, as the official JSawyer Ultimate Edition Patches page now has a patch for those two mods) <br>
                - Added instructions to Gameplay - PTWB's Mods to install the JSUE - Mojave Raiders patch from the JSawyer Ultimate Edition Patches page (the plugin is merged in Gameplay - Finish)<br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>9/10/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Fun update, pretty much just un-did everything from the previous update (realized I could just make my own patches for Iron Sights Recoil Animations and upload them here since it has open permissions, rather than have users create their own. If you already did the Sniff patching youself, there's no need to update anything) <br>
                - Added my Iron Sights Recoil Animations WMIM and WRP patches to Textures/Models/Animations (WRP patch isn't in the low section since WRP itself isn't) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>9/09/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Moved Sniff from the Optional Tools section to the main tool section (now needed for patching Iron Sights Recoil Animations) <br>
                - Updated Iron Sights Recoil Animations instructions for the new version (needs manual patching now) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>9/1/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added Item Icons Redux to Core - HUD/UI (also installed in Gameplay - PTWB's Mods for the patches for JSUE and Mojave Arsenal)
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>8/31/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added a note to disable <strong>bReplaceHashingAlgorithm</strong> in the NVTF.ini
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>8/18/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Securitrons on High Alert from the optional visuals section, but it IS STILL in the Content section after FPGE (small oversight on my part, the FPGE version is a replacer of the entire ESP rather than just a patch, meaning you would have two versions of the mod installed and have two identical scripts running. And since the mod was originally merged into the visuals merge, it wouldve been pretty hard and just kinda excessive to have instructions for rebuilding the merge without it. Overall its not that big a deal since its still in the guide, but I figured it was worth going into detail about.)
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>8/17/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - [General] Small reformatting of the guide's layout. A handful of mods have been added to the new optional section for Visuals, as well as a few other additions/removals. Those will be listed below. I won't list all the specifics of everything thats just moved and why, because its not something you need to do if you've already installed the guide. (adding this later, ended up being a pretty big update cause of the new section and a couple of major mod updates [those mods being Stewie's Tweaks and JSawyer Ultimate Edition]) <br>
                - [General] - Core/Gameplay/Content Conflict Resolution updated,  Stewie's Tweaks Custom INI updated, JSUE Addendum updated, Lore Friendly Armor Pack update (details are in the announcement channel on Discord) <br>
                - [Core/Gameplay] Moved Collision Meshes to Gameplay - Mechanics (although it is mainly a QOL mod, it can have a performance hit due to the new complex meshes, which I don't think fits well with Core's philosophy of the best stability/performance) <br>
                - [Core] Removed Weapon Mod Menu from HUD/UI (redundant with newest stewie's tweaks update) <br>
                - [Core] Removed White Glove Mask Fisk from the optional section (no longer conflict free in newest version of JSUE) <br>
                - [Visuals] Added 1st Person Animation Replacers to all Texture/Models section (now called Textures/Models/Animations) <br>
                - [Visuals] Added Cataract eyes, McCarran Escalator Glass, McCarran Main Terminal Transparent Glass, Better Posture, Alsatian NCR Guard Dogs Fallout 4 Robobrains, Animated Terminal Screen Savers, Simple Main Menu HD, Main Title Consistent Replacer, Vanilla Loading Screens HD to all of the new Optionals Visuals sections <br>
                - [Visuals] Replaced Securitrons in CRT with Securitrons on High Alert in Optional Visuals (its also reinstalled in Content after FPGE to install the patch) <br>
                - [Visuals] Added Millenia's Env Map Shader Package Fix to all Visuals Textures/Models/Animations sections <br>
                - [Visuals] Visuals Conflict resolution is no longer needed due to ESP-editing and the new optional sections (see below for more)<br>
                - [Visuals] The YUP - WRP patch is now uploaded separately and installed after WRP like a normal mod (the patch itself has not changed) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Added Perk-Style JIP CCC Icons to gameplay mechanics made by <a class="modsublink" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/31380295" target="_blank">TheIncredibleKraken</a> (thanks for making it and for giving me permission to use it) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Exchanged Immersive Recoil with Real Recoil + AnonPlum's Real Recoil Fixes. It's not included in the gameplay merge (although it needs patching in its INI for modded ammo types, the guide doesn't have any of those besides in JSUE [which the separate fix mod covers] and I think its recoil feels much smoother, especially with automatic weapons [you can also change the recoil amount per ammo type, vs. just the universal multiplier in Immersive Recoil]. You can keep Immersive Recoil if you prefer it. Thus concludes the messiest changelog entry ever) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Removed Well Rested Overhaul and Take Chems Make Fiends from the optional section (no longer conflict free in newest version of JSUE) <br>
                - [Gameplay] Added Vicious Wastelands Stadalone Mechanics (Barter Affects Repair Costs), Stat Choices, and NPCs Use Aid Items to the optional gameplay section <br>
                - [Content] Added th3overseer Quest Mod Bugfixes to Content - New Quests/Locations (merged in the content merge) <br>
                - [Content] Added NCR Trooper Overhaul and NCR Trooper Overhaul Distributed to the equipment section (ESPs hidden, heavily edited in the armor pack. make sure you update that)
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>7/28/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added No Snow in Globes - Snowglobe Performance to Core - Optional Bug Fixes/QOL <br>
                - Removed Universal Item Sorter (rather useless with Stewie's Tweaks inventory searching/sorting) <br>
                - Added Bowie Knife Retexture and Throwing Melee Retexture to Visuals High - Textures/Models <br>
                - Added a note about enabling the new NPCs use weapon mods feature in JIP LN to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Exchanged Passive Combat Music for Passive Combat Music Tweaked <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/26/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added the new Mojave Raiders - TLD Patch to Content - Restored/Improved <br>
                - Removed the need to download the Underpass Remover from TLD (not needed with the above patch) <br>
                - Added Nevada Skies to the note about alternative weather mods (was updated again, is back to being good) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/17/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Swapped A Trait Mod with Opposite Traits (opposite traits is more balanced and feels more vanilla, and I didn't want to overwhelm the amount of traits so I didn't want both at the same time) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/15/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added Discord Rich Presence to Core - Optional Utilities <br>
                - Added No Muzzle Flash Lights to Core - Optional Bug Fix/QOL <br>
                - Exchanged NVSE for xNVSE (an updated version of NVSE that will fix bugs/improve performance) <br>
                - Added an Audio section to the Content Module
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>5/30/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added xEdit instructions for B42 Quickthrow to make the invisible NPC who throws items silent, so he doesn't scream every time you throw something (thanks Stewie)
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>5/28/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Updated NVTF edit instructions in accordance to new update <br>
                - Re-removed OneTweak (no longer needed with new NVTF) <br>
                - Removed Inventory Search (replaced by newest version of lStewieAl's Tweaks) <br>
            </p>

                - Removed instructions to enable bUseD3D9Ex in NVTF's .ini (critical memory bug was discovered with it) <br>
                - Temporarily re-added OneTweak to Core - Optional Utilities (the setting in NVTF that had to be turned off is the one that enables fullscreen alt-tabbing, will be removed again once that bug is fixed and the setting can be re-enabled) <br>
                - Temporarily(?) removed California Fonts from Optional HUD/UI (hidden on Nexus)

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>5/9/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Updated NVTF editing instructions in accordance to its new updates <br>
                - Removed OneTweak (new NVTF settings allow for safe alt-tabbing in fullscreen) <br>
                - Added Mod Limit Fix to Core - Utilities (even though the guide doesn't even come close to the plugin limit, it still may potentially improve load times and performance)
                - Added WMIM Addendum to Core - Bug Fix, which is basically just the old xEdit instructions along with a few other tweaks in its own plugin <br>
                - Moved Inventory Search to HUD - Optional (was supposed to be there originally, just forgot)
                - Removed Mojave Sandy Desert from Visuals - Medium (replaces all varities of ground textures with the same texture, having the variety from Poco Bueno is beter) <br>
                - Removed Much Needed LOD from all the LOD sections (many of the meshes were much too complex for LODGen to handle) <br>
                - Added Wasteland Flora Overhaul, UHQ, and Wasteland in Bloom to High Visuals <br>
                - Removed STDG and Simple Street Lights from the Visuals - Merge (to avoid problems with people who didn't hide the original ESPs and had problems, its fine to keep in the merge if you didn't run into any problems)
                - Switched out <strong>bDisableSneakAttackCriticals</strong> with <strong>bSneakCriticalsOnlyMeleeWeapons</strong> in Gameplay - Mechanics Stewie's Tweaks section <br>
                - Added Qolore Gameplay Tweaks to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Added my JSUE Addendum, Mojave Raiders Addendum, BLEED Addendum to Gameplay - Mechanics (all included in Gameplay - Merge too)<br>
                - Added The Living Desert to Content - Improved Content (it is 'safe' to install mid playthrough, but you will miss out on many of its features depending on how far along you are)
                - Added REPCONN Blues Tweaks and Afterschool Special Tweaks to Content - New Quests (both included in Content - Merge) <br>
                - Added Ammo Count Memory to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Removed Occlusion Overhaul from Core - Bug Fixes (incompatible with mods that remove objects from the affected areas, which WFO does. I know they are in separate modules and I could technically keep it around but it makes upkeep more complicated for me and many users will mis-read instructions and cause pretty intense bugs) <br>
                - Added Lightweight Strip Overhaul to Content - Improved/Restored Vanilla Content (maybe fits better in Visuals, but who actually cares) <br>
                - Added the Uncut Wasteland Extra Collection file to Content - Restored/Improved Vanilla Content <br>
                - Updated all Load Orders/Conflict Resolutions to reflect new additions/removals <br>
                - Updated Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks, all FNVLODGen Outputs, VNV Follower Tweaks, and the Lore Friendly Armor/Weapons Pack <br>
                - Added "To Avoid" sections to the top of the Finish Line pages of all modules <br>
                - Re-added FOV slider to Core - HUD/UI Optional (accidentally got removed) <br>
                - Added Enhanced Blood Textures to High Visuals <br>
                - Removed Dynamic Pip-Boy light (not many people take advantage of it, RWL Tweaked boosts pip-boy light readius, and it has pretty over-complex scripting) <br>
                - Added Starting Gear Overhaul to Gameplay - Optional Mechanics <br>

                This may seem like a big update by looking at the size of the changelog, but most of it is format and update stuff rather than actually contents of the guide being added/removed <br> <br>
                Starting with the actual additions/removals: <br>
                - Removed NVGE/NVR from Core - Utilities, along with all the preset INI (way too many bugs and potential performance loss to warrant keeping around for what little upside it may have. May be re-introduced if the big update thats on the way fixes the problems) <br>
                - Removed RTSS from Core - Tools (can sometimes cause issues with MO2's VFS and an FPS cap really isn't needed anymore with NVTF) <br>
                - Added Occulsion Overhaul to Core - Bug Fixes <br>
                - Switched from CASM back to the ESPless save system in Stewie's Tweaks (the save game bug with Stewie's Tweaks has since been identified and fixed) <br>
                - Exchanged Loot Menu for Just Loot Menu in Core - HUD/UI <br>
                - Switched DarnUI to the updated TTW version (now has an oHUD patch so it is a straight improvement from the old version) <br>
                - Removed all the optional DarnUI stuff (included in the TTW version) <br> 
                - Removed ILO (interior tweaks included in my new tweaked RWL plugin)<br>
                - Exchanged Fellout for my tweaked version of RWL (yes i know switching weather mods is a meme at this point, the gods just dont want it to be i guess) <br>
                - Added a note to the lStewieAl's Tweaks part in Gameplay - Mechanics about enabling the new <strong>bBarterCheckActorBuySellFlags</strong> feature, along with a custom mod meant to compliment it<br>
                - Replaced Rewarding Exploring with GRA Relocated (better placement and balance, Gameplay Conflict Resolution was also updated to reflect this change) <br>
                - Added NPCs Sprint to Gameplay - Mechanics and to the Gameplay - Merge <br> 
                - Added Dead Money Stealth Fix, Better Archimedes II, and some of Mastahbossu's Misc Mods to Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks <br>
                - Added Recharger Rifle Rebalance with Scope Mod and Dead Money Toxic Cloud fix to Gameplay - Optional Mechanics <br>
                - Removed Future Fallout Chems and Fallout 76 Mutations (wasn't happy with the overall balance of them, updated Content - Conflict Resolution to reflect this) <br><br>
                And now for the format changes: <br>
                - Made "optional" sections after each Core step that contain smaller, easily mergeable mods that don't require conflict resolution <br>
                - Merged the Bug Fix and QOL steps (with moving some mods to optional, the step became too small to keep on its own) <br>
                - Changed the installation of all the Utilities to manual rather than normally through MO2 <br>
                - Added instructions to install the releasefast version of NVSE (issues with it and JIP LN are now fixed) <br>
                - Changed OneTweak link to the more recently updated Skyrim page
                - All guide emporium files are now hosted on Github rather than Nexus (fuck you Nexus) <br>
                - Updated lStewieAl's Tweaks INI <br>
                - Moved Melee Reach Fixed, Sierra Madre Exterior Fixed, Enslaving Arcade Fix, Female White Glove Society Mask, Motion Sickness Destroyer, Unnecessary Tweaks, and Wear Glasses with Masks to the Optional Bug Fixes/QOL Improvements <br>
                - Added Lucky 38 World LOD Fix and Psycho and Slasher Bonus Damage Fix to the optional Bug Fixes/QOL Improvements <br>
                - Moved Quickthrow, Retrievable Throwables, Just Mods Assorted, and JIP CCC to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Moved MCM Matches HUD Color, Caravan Card Control, MTUI Dialogue Background, and No Traps Popup to Optional HUD/UI <br>
                - Moved Bypass Minigames, Well Rested Overhaul, Better NCR Supply Cache, Honest Hearts Workbench Crate Luck and Take Chems Make Fiends to Mechanics - Optional <br>
                - Updated Vault 22 Flora Overhaul ESP Replacer (removed even more junk from it, all the out of place stuff should now be gone) <br>
                - Updated all Conflict Resolutions and Load Orders where necessary

                - A NexusMods account is now required <br>

                Guys I fucked up and kinda did a big update again my b (this will all work on an existing save but also remember you don't need to do any of this. also i accidentally deleted this changelog the first time i made it so if i missed a thing or two oops come and yell at me on Discord) <br>
                - Exchanged UPP for UPNVSE (potentially controversial change, but is long overdue imo) <br>
                - Removed Reactivated Hit Topics and Rebreather Fixed from Core - Bug Fixes (redundant with UPNVSE) <br>
                - Removed Asterra's Many Fixes (there have been a lot of problematic meshes with that mod, and bad meshes are the #1 cause of crashes) <br>
                - Removed Enhanced Camera (semi-badly made mod overall, causes clipping in first person with some armors, especially custom ones which makes them completely unwearable. Also small conflict with Just Vanilla Sprint that can't really be fixed, only worked around) <br>
                - Exchanged the saving system in Stewie's Tweaks for CASM MCM (common bug with the tweaks that would cause loading saves to crash the game unless you started a new game and loaded the save from there, CASM doesn't have this problem)
                - Exchanged Realistic Wasteland Lighting for Nevada Skies (NS just got its last big update and is now a great mod) <br>
                - Removed Interior Fog Remover (incorporated into Stewie's Tweaks) <br>
                - Added Pre-generated LOD to the visuals module for if you followed the texture setup 1:1 <br>
                - Removed enabling of Fallout 3 Repair (made early game repair frustrating rather than difficult yet rewarding) <br>
                - Updated YGT (now includes Faction Armor Redone and Loot All Vehicles, along with a few others) <br>
                - Added VNV Follower Tweaks to Gameplay - Mechanics (you will need to fire all your companions and re-hire them for the changes to take effect) <br>
                - Added Less Rewarding Exploring to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Updated all Conflict Resolutions

                - Updated the NVGE preset, so the Water INI tweaks are no longer needed, also added a note about enabling the AO if you want

                - Added instructions to hide the meshes/scol folder from LOD Additions and Improvements and Much Needed LOD, and the textres/scol folder from Much Needed LOD (mesh from LOD Additions and Improvments is broken, textures/meshes from Much Needed LOD are for electro city. if youve already ran FNVLODGen without issues, you dont need to re-run it)<br>
                - Moved BSA Decompressor and OGG Vorbis Librariers to Core - Tools to hopefully stop people complaining about missing meshes because they can't read (if youve already installed the guide you dont need to do any of the moving around that im doing, its just to make it easier for people to follow) <br>
                - Moved UIO and MCM to top of Core - QOL (since some mods in Core - QOL require the MCM, and theres a specific bug with FOV slider that happens if you dont have MCM installed) <br>
                - Exchanged Stimpak Hotkey and Hotkey Scroll Wheel for Just Weapon Hweel (dont know if it needs to be said but this is fine to change on an existing save) <br>

                - Okay, this is about to be a massive wall of text. This update is the biggest one yet for the guide. Inspired by a recent Fallout 4 playthrough I did with a minimal amount of mods, 
                I've decided to remove a lot of the mods that I felt didn't affect gameplay enough to be included. I won't go into too much detail since I've been talking about it for a while on Discord, but even through
                a bunch of mods are being removed, you should barely notice any affect on your actual gameplay if any. And also this update, despite the size, should be fine on an existing save. 
                As always I can't promise that's the case, but you should be fine. Okay, lets get started: <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Core module:</strong> <br>
                Changed NVSE install instructions to download the recently released version <br>
                Re-added OneTweak, in turn changed install instructions for NVGE
                Added sub-sections at the end of most sections containing mods/tools that should be avoided
                Added FNVEdit editing to WMIM to fix a few bugs <br>
                Removed Legion AI/Combat Bark Fix (most important changes are covered by Asterra's Many Fixes, the one's that aren't weren't worth keeping) <br>
                Removed Reinforced Leather Armor Female Mesh Fix (shouldnt need to explain myself on this one) <br>
                Removed Fixed War Room Table (see above) <br>
                Removed Cass Class Fix (tag skills don't affect her gameplay) <br>
                Caleb McCaffery NPC and Hat Bug Fixes (fixes already done by YUP, albeit in a less efficient way) <br>
                Removed Nightkin Scripts Corrected (see above) <br>
                Added FNVEdit editing to Rebreather Tweaked <br>
                Exchanged Vendors Containers Respawn Fix for Simpler Vendor Respawn Fix (my version is a lot simpler as you can tell by the name, requires less conflict resolution) <br>
                Removed SafeAutoSave (ESPless alternative now in Stewie's Tweaks) <br>
                Added Asterra's Many Fixes - Collision Meshes Patch <br>
                Updated Stewie Tweaks INI to reflect new version <br>
                Removed all of the individual c6 (nvse) mods and replaced them with his tweaks package <br>
                Eddie Hears an Explosion will be moved to Content - Improved Vanilla Quests or whatever its called <br>
                Barton Thorn Acts Normally removed (the fact that he will follow you to the ends of the earth was more annoying than immersive) <br>
                Removed Clean Character Creation (some people just dont play on hardcore, also revised character thing might be usefull for like one person) <br>
                Removed First Aid NVSE (giving already OP companions chems is not a good idea) <br>
                Removed Muzzle Flash Control (not noticable) <br>
                Lonesome Road Roughin It Bedroll Kit Fix <br> (original implementation never bothered me, perfect example of me adding a mod because it exists rather than it actually being necessary) <br>
                Removed Day Tripper and Chemist Survivalist Style Fix (mostly fixed by YUP, albeit in a less efficient way. Also some changes are more gameplay oriented than QOL) <br>
                I think I moved Johnson Nash NCR Ammo Fix to Content - Improved Vanilla Quests if I even kept it idk oops <br>
                Removed Bypass Minigames (oh yeah was gonna replace this with something and forgot probably should get on that) <br>
                Exchanged individual Just mods with JustModsMered <br>
                Removed Project FNVIcons and all its related patches (no one ever checks the challenges tab anyways lol, also made for some annoying CR down the line) <br>
                Added Vanilla HUD Remastered to the DarnUI HUD section (guess I forgot to add it to this section?) <br>
                Updated the Conflict Resolution/Load Order.txt/Merge instructions <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Visuals section:</strong> <br>
                Changed order of Poco/NMC/Mgs (based on a poll I did in the Discord) <br>
                Removed Textures Over Time Sandstone/Stone Walls (was fine with Poco's implementation of both) <br>
                Updated ToT Honest Hearts LOD Fix (resizes 4k rock texture now too) <br>
                Added PM's HD Legion Overhaul (heart eyes emoji) <br>
                Removed Wasteland Clothing HD (mostly shitty AI upscaling, not worth performance impact)
                Replaced The Gruntening with Bornagain Combat Armor (preference) <br>
                Removed Shifting Shadows and Metal Armor Metalized (the leather parts of the metal armor looked more like footballs than actual leather used for clothing which made it look out of place) <br>
                Removed NCR Civilian Clothing (more of a recolor rather than actual retexture tbh) <br>
                Removed Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia (not compatible with WMIM) <br>
                Removed Nail Gun Retexture (has anyone ever used this gun before?) <br>
                Added instructions for hiding textures in EXE to prevent the pixelated water bug thing <br>
                Replaced Improved Cyberdogs Textures with Its a Dog's World (preference) <br>
                Removed the following due to un-noticablility: High Resolution Bulletin Board and Primm Flyers, High Res Vanilla Posters and Graffiti, Tweaked Cash Register, Hectrol Tumbleweed High Res Retex, Higher-Resolution Westside Craftsman Window, High Resolution Bobby Pin Box, Retextured Playing Cards, Lucky Shades use Authority Glasses Model, Boone's Machete is a Broad Machete, Improved Rawhide Cowboy Hat Mesh, Adjusted Gambler Hats <br>
                Removed Sheriff Meyers (Sheriff Duster/Hat are unique in vanilla, didnt want to change that) <br>
                Removed Pip-Boys to the People due to CR complications, might return if a few things go my way <br>
                Removed Mr. Gutsy/Handy Animated Eyes (eyes keep blinking after death, very uncanny) <br>
                Removed Mother Lupa and Vicious Violetta (bad dogs) <br>
                Updated Character Expansion Instructions for the new update <br>
                Removed High Resolution Male Body Textures (4k textures, not noticeable even for hand textures since most armors have gloves) <br>
                Removed Distributed Necklaces/Chains (after discussion on the Discord, necklaces werent lore friendly enough, weird that they show up on every NPC) <br>
                Removed Better Posture (not everyone is perfect, okay?) <br>
                Removed Gun Follows Crosshairs in First Person <br>
                Removed the entire Menu Visuals section and implemented Better Pause Menu into Tex/Models <br>
                Updated Conflict Resolution/Load Order.txt/etc for new update <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Gameplay Module:</strong> <br>
                Updated Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks to remove a lot of the included mods that were too small, plugin was an absolute mess so i built it from the ground up, no more issues and a lot less patches are needed) <br>
                Removed VATS Alternative (JustModsMerged now has bullet time) <br>
                Removed the entire Gameplay - Combat/AI section, integrated BLEED and Melee Cleave into Gameplay - Mechanics (only the AI mods were actually removed, the AI mods were useless and honestly just made combat less fun) <br>
                Removed Cannibal Reborn <br>
                Removed Lonesome Road Flare Ammo (very niche item so it doesnt matter to me) <br>
                Will move Birds of a Feather Bear Arms Together to Content - Vanilla Quests Improved <br>
                Updated all the finish line shit i think you get the drill by now <br> <br>
                Okay that's it! (probably missed some stuff in the changelog, im only human). Come to the discord and yell at me for removing your favorite mod! <br>
                On a serious note, I've been working on this update for a while after going on a hiatus for a bit. This will be the last major update to the guide like this, should only be adding mods here and there as they release/get updated/etc. Thanks for all the continued support, I hope you guys understand the basis of these changes.

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Fix for the Legion Armors and Survivalist Style Fix from the Core - Merge for the time being (complications with how zMerge handles assigning FormIDs and how that affects conflict resolution. This should only be a temporary solution) <br>
                - Removed Collision Meshes - Ojo Bueno Patch from Visuals - Textures/Models (Poco Bueno has different meshes than Ojo Bueno and would need a different patch)
            </p>
        <br>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed HeroinZero's Weapon Fixes from Core - Bug Fixes (all the fixes not done by WMIM need to be done at engine level according to RoyBatty) <br>

                - Removed Unnecessary Physics from Core - QOL (like the title of the mod says, its unnecessary and only a fun gimmick for the first minute of two of playing with it)
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/23/19</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Convenient Companion Inventory from Core - QOL (recalculates formula after almost menu which can cause lag later on in a save as the file size gets bigger) <br>

            </p>

                - Added a note about MenuMode 4 scripts to Core - Bug Fix (I should probably make a separate page for all the notes I write shouldn't I broken) <br>
                - Added Logic and Consistency Fixes to Core - QOL <br>
                - Added instructions for editing ILO in xEdit for compatibility with the above mod in Visuals - Environment/Lighting <br>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Re-did the FNVLODGen settings (pretty much just used default terrain LOD settings for the best option and simplicity's sake)
            </p>
        <br> 
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/16/19</strong></p>

                - Removed Legion AI Fix from the Core - Merge (didnt want to deal with people having the voice assets error, plugin space is completely fine anyways) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from Fallout 4 Styled BoS Uniforms in all Visuals - Textures/Models sections (should've been hidden because of the .esp replacer, I just forgot) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from the main file of Olly's Thematic Loadscreen Pack (.esp is replaced by the optional file, main file needs to be hidden so it doesnt show up after you merge the .esp from the optional file) <br>
                - Replaced Character Creation Streamlined with Clean Character Creation in Core - QOL (incompatible with the new version of Character Creation Plus, added CCC to the Core - Merge) <br>
                - Removed Vanilla Intro Plus from Core - QOL (don't really know why I put it in the QOL section in the first place, will most likely be back in the content section) <br>
                - Changed the NVGE install instructions to no longer include the main menu music that would play whenever you went from in-game back to the main menu even if the intro is off in the INI

                - Removed Zion Door Fix from Core - Bug Fix <br>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Finished the Gameplay module! <br>
                - Removed Improved Quest Objectives from Core - QOL and updated the Core/Gameplay Conflict Resolution FOMODs to reflect that (edits quest scripts/stages, makes for a lot of incompatibility. only included initially because i was going to include a mod that removed a lot of quest markers but it wouldve taken years to do the conflict resolution)

            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>5/24/19</strong></p>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Changed instructions for running FNVLODGen (now uses -o: argument due to new information about MO2 not being able to hook files fast enough doing it the other way)

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>5/19/19</strong></p>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Ownerless trash, Lonesome Road True Faction Allegiance, Common Caravan Deck, and Casino Exchange All from Core - QOL (ditching these in favor of a newly edited version of Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks provided by Sigourn)
